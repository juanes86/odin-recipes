This project has been my first ever website built from scratch!
It was so difficult to get to this point and although it's not
the nicest website ever built I'm super happy that I managed to 
make it this far and very greatful for The Odin Project for laying
the foundation for me and many others. This website displays
skills that I have learned along my journey and display my skills
with html. A lot of memorization I have noticed is required, but 
just like any language its a given. While I did find getting to this
stage very challenging I'm super excited to finally see my work in
action. To the person reading this, know you're only as good 
as you believe you are, and know you're enough and you're amazing.
